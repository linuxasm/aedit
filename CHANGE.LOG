1-17-2005 Fixed problem with running as different
          user or root.  It now give a message about
          missing setup files.

2-11-2005 comment highlighting was lost after switching
          files with "other" command.  The fix was to add
          show_asm, and asm_comment_char to a.ini save.
          Also, the block flags were added, blockbegin,
          blockend, showblock.  Now, the status of comment
          hightlighting is saved at ~/.a/a.ini

          Getting 'a' setup after changing the a.ini file
          was tough.  Had to recompile a_config and do
          install over and over.  a_config will not overwrite
          an old a.ini so it had to be deleted over and
          over.  It appears to be a problem with order of
          events.  The a_config needs to happen first?

4-13-2005 Fixed problem writting file without any
          attributes.

4-13-2005 Fixed problem with macro repeat stopping the
          second time forever option selected.

10-10-2005 Fixed problem with writting history file a.ini.
          If first call to asmedit was root user it stored
          the a.ini file with root permissions in local users
          directory.  This prevented access by normal users.

11-18-2005 Fixed problem with goto,line.  The buffer pointed
          at by [edi] had garbage with was displayed.  The fix
          was to put zero at start of buffer.

11-18-2005 Fixed problem with use of temp files at /tmp/asmedit.tmp.
          It files were created by root they could not be written
          by normal user and program would fail.  The solutions was
          a kludge.  If root user then the files are deleted from
          /tmp upon exit.  A better solution would be to write files
          with permission 666, but current file_write can not do this.

09-19-2006 Added clear_block to escape key processing.  This was
          added to fix problem with highlight of block when it
          should not be highlighted

09-19-2006 Added winch code to handle resize of window.  See
          signal.inc

09-19-2006 Changed "g" get command to get buffer if <enter> key and
          exit if <ESC> or <ctrl-c>

08-18-2007 Modified DeleteByte to check if at end of file.  If true
           exit with error.  This fixes problems with replace all
           and possibly other delete-all or repeat-all-macro functions.

08-18-2007 Dumped display size code and just called asmlib to get
           window size.  This adds a lot of extra code, but was
           the easy fix.  see set_window_size.

10-09-2007 Changed macro processing again to try and detect end of
           a macro in the "forever" mode.

           Added tab key in command mode - it now switches to other
           window.

           Updated documention to mention asmbug.  Left in kdbg mention,
           even though it doesn't run here anymore.
